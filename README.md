# TypeScripting

I'm working with TypeScript. I've tried my hand at implementing a virtual computer such as you use for NandGame's Stack Machine levels. I also have a program that provides some geometry stuff.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure you have TypeScript installed on your computer
2. Ensure that npm and its dependencies are installed and functional
3. Download and run the files

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open your IDE.
2. Pull up the program files.
3. If there is no "main.js" file, go to the terminal and run the command "npx tsc main.ts". This should create a file called "main.js".
4. Run main.js.
5. Repeat the previous two steps for tuples.ts.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* TypeScript- latest version should do
* JavaScript- latest version should also be okay

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php)
* [NandGame.com](https://nandgame.com)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make sure control unit instructions all work like in NandGame; possibly extend instruction set, e.g. adding lshift and rshift statements
* [ ] Add "shared variables", "labels", and other things for added functionality and versatility, such as simulated breakpoints
* [ ] Add options for implementing simulated higher-level languages
